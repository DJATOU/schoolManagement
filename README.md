- Teacher Assignments: Assign teachers to specific groups and manage their schedules.
- Payment System: Calculate session prices, track payments from students, and handle financial reporting.
- Attendance Tracking: Record and analyze student attendance for each session.
- Robust Reporting: Generate detailed reports on attendance, payments, and other statistical data.

Technologies Used:
- Backend developed with Java, Spring Boot, and JPA/Hibernate.
- PostgreSQL for database management.
- Frontend (TBD/In Progress/Planned).

This project is designed to be scalable, flexible, and easy to use, catering to the diverse needs of educational institutions.
